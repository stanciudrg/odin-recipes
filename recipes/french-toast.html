        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>French toast is a dish made of sliced bread soaked in beaten eggs, sugar and typically milk, then pan fried.
            Alternative names and variants include "eggy bread", "Bombay toast', "gypsy toast", and "poor knights" (of
            Windsor).</p>
        <p>When French toast is served as a sweet dish, milk, sugar, vanilla or cinnamon are also commonly added before
            pan-frying, and then it may be topped with sugar (often powdered sugar), butter, fruit, or syrup. When it is
            a
            savory dish, it is generally fried with a pinch of salt or pepper, and it can then be served with a sauce as
            ketchup or mayonnaise.</p>
