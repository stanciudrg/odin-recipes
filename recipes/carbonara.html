        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><span lang="it">Carbonara</span> is an italian pasta dish from Rome usually made with eggs, hard cheese,
            cured
            pork and black pepper. The dish arrived at its modern form, with its current name, in the middle of the 20th
            century.</p>
        <p>The cheese is usually <span lang="it">Pecorino Romano</span>, <span lang="it">Parmigiano-Reggiano</span>, or
            a
            combination of the two. <span lang="it">Spaghetti</span> is the most common pasta, but <span
                lang="it">fettuccine</span>, <span lang="it">rigatoni</span>, <span lang="it">linguine</span>, or <span
                lang="it">bucatini</span> are also used. Normally <span lang="it">guanciale</span> or <span
                lang="it">pancetta</span> are used for the meat component, but <span lang="fr">lardons</span> of smoked
            bacon are a common substitute outside Italy.</p>
        <h3>- Ingredients -</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound <span lang="it">spaghetti</span></li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>9 slices bacon, diced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>&frac14; cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>&frac12; cup grated Parmesan</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt and black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>- Steps -</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook <span lang="it">spaghetti</span> pasta until <span
                    lang="it">al
                    dente</span></li>
            <li>Meanwhile in a large skillet, cook chopped bacon until slightly crisp; remove and drain onto paper
                towels,
                Reserve 2 tablespoons of bacon fat; add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, and heat in reused large
                skillet.
                Add chopped onion, and cook over medium heat until onion is translucent. Add minced garlic, and cook 1
                minute more. Add wine if desired; cook one more minute.</li>
            <li>Return cooked bacon to pan; add cooked and drained spaghetti. Toss to coat and heat through, adding more
                olive oil if it seems dry or is sticking together. Add beaten eggs and cook, tossing constantly with
                tongs
                or large fork until eggs are barely set. Quickly add &frac12; cup Parmesan cheese, and toss again. Add
                salt
                and pepper to taste (remember that bacon and Parmesan are very salty).</li>
            <li>Serve immediately with chopped parsley sprinkled on top, and extra Parmesan cheese at table.</li>
        </ol>
